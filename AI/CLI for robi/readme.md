## 🚀 CLI for Robi​
A minimal local LLM interface for Robi.

---
​
## 📌 Motivation​
Keep it Simple: Sometimes a terminal is all you need.​

Stay Offline: Designed to run LLM power directly on my local machine, 
bypassing the need for a stable connection 
(especially when Wi-Fi isn't working).​

Save Context: Integrated history logging so Robi actually remembers what we talked about.

## 🛠 Tech Stack​

The Brain: Custom Ollama model (Robi is my own fine-tuned model).

​Language: C++.
